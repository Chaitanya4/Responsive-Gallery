    <h1>National Policy on HIV AIDS</h1>
    <p>The HIV/AIDS epidemic constitutes one of the most formidable challenges to development and social progress. The epidemic exacerbates poverty and inequality, and increases the burden on the most vulnerable people in society i.e. the elderly, the women, children and the poor. Countries and organizations that do not respond in time have to bear huge costs on public and private sector enterprises through declining productivity, loss of skilled and experienced labour and increased expenditures on employee treatment and associated costs as the demand for public services increases. National economies, as seen in the severely affected regions like the sub-Saharan Africa, have experienced the impact on virtually every sector.</p>
